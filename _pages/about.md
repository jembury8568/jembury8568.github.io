<p><b>Current Role:</b><br>
  <em>Graduate research assistant at San Diego State University (SDSU)</em></p>{: .notice}

<p><b>What do you do at SDSU?</b><br>
<em>I use spatial analysis and modeling to study human dynamics. 
For my thesis, I am developing a simulation model of regular mobility and activity in San Diego County. <br><br>
I am also a research assistant for the Encoding Geography project - a collaboration spanning 7 organizations that is building a framework for developing inclusive and community responsive geocomputational curricula.</em></p>{: .notice}

<p><b>What do you like about studying at SDSU?</b><br>
<em>The community, and the opportunity to collaborate with different people with diverse backgrounds and skill sets.</em></p>{: .notice}

<p><b>What are your credentials and achievements?</b><br>
<em>I have a B.S. in Geography and am working on a M.S. in Geographic Information Science. I have collaborated on a number of interdisciplinary research projects on topics related to public health and food landscapes. I also worked as a GIS intern for the City of San Diego's Open Space Division.<br><br>
I have received several awards recognizing my research: SDSU's 2022-23 University Graduate Fellowship and 2021-22 Master's Research Scholarship, Esri Innovation Program's <a href="https://community.esri.com/t5/education-blog/2021-esri-innovation-program-students-of-the-year/ba-p/1073601">2021 Student of the Year Award</a>, American Association of Geographer's <a href="https://www.aag.org/award-grant/marble-boyle/">2021 Marble-Boyle Undergraduate Achievement Award in Geographic Science</a>, Association of Pacific Coast Geographer's <a href="https://www.csusm.edu/geography/documents/2021_apcg_student_awards_notification.pdf">2021 Geosystems Award for Excellence in Applied Geography</a>.</em></p>{: .notice}

<p><b>What are your favorite tools?</b><br>
<em>Python and PostgreSQL with PostGIS. I work with a lot of big data, so programming and database skills are essential to my research.</em></p>{: .notice}

<p><b>What is something geographers have to deal with that you want to fix?</b><br>
<em>I want to help make geography - and the geocomputation niche - more inclusive and welcoming for everyone. I'd like to see more diversity in the discipline.</em></p>{: .notice}
