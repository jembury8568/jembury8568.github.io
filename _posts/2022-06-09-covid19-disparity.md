### Overview
Beginning March 2020, I researched COVID-19 health disparity and population vulnerability in San Diego County with the Center for Human Dynamics in the Mobile Age (HDMA) at SDSU. I am a major contributor to the HDMA Center's [COVID-19 Research Hub](https://hdma-sdsu.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, which featured daily data updates during the peak of the pandemic. I also provided spatial support to an interdisciplinary SDSU project that brought mobile COVID-19 testing centers into underserved communities.

I presented my work from March 2020 - March 2021 at the American Association of Geographers Annual Meeting in April 2021. (11 minutes)

After the presentation, I extended the research to assess whether spatial modeling of chronic disease can indicate COVID-19 population vulnerability.

### Objectives
To support localized public health policies, the study analyzed the relationships between COVID-19, chronic disease, and socioeconomic variables. The study has two research questions:
1. Which socioeconomic variables, correlated with COVID-19 and chronic disease rates, are potential social determinants of health
2. Can spatial modeling of chronic disease rates identify the communities that are most vulnerable to COVID-19?
